- `scijava-jupyter-kernel` aims to be a polyglot Jupyter kernel. It uses the Scijava scripting languages to execute the code in Jupyter client and it's possible to use different languages in the same notebook.

Some of the supported languages are Groovy (default), Python, Beanshell, Clojure, Java, Javascript, Ruby and Scala.
